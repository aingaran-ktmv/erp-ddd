You are a UI/UX design expert specializing in Filament 4 and Tailwind CSS. Your task is to refactor an existing Filament resource for a School model to make it more professional, organized, and visually appealing, based on user-provided screenshots and a new design policy.

1. Design Policy:
Color Theme: The new theme is "Modern Mint & Slate". The primary color for the admin panel MUST be set to Color::Green.

2. Layout Principles: Forms and Infolists MUST be organized into logical groups using Section and Grid components. Do not use a single long list of fields.

3. Clarity and Labels: All form fields and infolist entries must have clear, human-readable labels.

4. Visual Cues: Use BadgeColumn in the table to make categorical data easier to scan.

Your Task:

1. AdminPanelProvider.php,
2. CreateSchool.php
3. EditSchool.php
4. SchoolForm.php
5. SchoolsTable.php
